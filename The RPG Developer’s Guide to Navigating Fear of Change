The RPG Developer’s Guide to Navigating Fear of Change
By George VanEaton — The RPG Blend

Change is the hardest part of modernization. Not the new tools. Not the code.
The mindset.

After decades working with RPG and IBM i teams, I’ve learned that the biggest barrier to progress isn’t technical—it’s emotional. Fear of making mistakes. Fear of looking inexperienced. Fear of losing relevance. These fears are real, and they show up in every modernization effort, from VS Code migrations to SQL conversions to Git adoption.

This guide explores how leaders and developers can understand, acknowledge, and move through those fears with clarity and confidence.

Why Fear of Change Is Normal

RPG developers carry decades of system knowledge, tribal workflows, and production responsibility. Change threatens predictability. It introduces uncertainty.
That’s human. The goal isn’t to eliminate fear—it’s to channel it.

The Difference Between Resistance and Uncertainty

Teams labeled as “resistant” are often simply unsure:

“Will I still be relevant?”

“What if I break something?”

“What if the new tool makes me look slow or unskilled?”

Your modernization program succeeds only when you address these questions, not ignore them.

How Leaders Can Help Developers Move Forward
1. Create Safety Without Lowering Standards

Psychological safety means developers feel supported and accountable.
Give them space to learn but hold a clear bar for progress.

2. Break Change Into Visible, Achievable Steps

Don’t roll out Git, VS Code, SQL, and unit testing in the same month.
Use progressive adoption. Celebrate small wins.

3. Train Consistently, Not Occasionally

Modernization isn’t a one-day training—it’s a habit.
Commit to cycles of learning: weekly labs, office hours, pairing sessions, guided tasks.

4. Provide Tools That Reduce Fear

Tools like VS Code, RDi, and soon Project Bob are not just productivity enhancers—they reduce cognitive load. They help developers see context, reduce mistakes, and gain confidence.

5. Make It Clear That Reinvention Is Part of the Job

Great RPG developers aren’t defined by what they used to know—they’re defined by how they adapt.

What Teams Gain When They Push Through the Fear

Modern RPG developers become:

More confident

More independent

Better collaborators

Stronger problem solvers

More prepared for future tooling shifts (including AI-enhanced workflows)

Modernization becomes less about survival and more about evolution.

Final Thoughts

Fear is not the enemy. Stagnation is.

When developers understand that change isn’t something happening to them but something happening for them, everything becomes possible.

Your IBM i platform stays powerful.
Your team becomes future-ready.
And modernization stops feeling like a threat and starts feeling like progress.
