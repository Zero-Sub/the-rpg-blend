Project Bob, VS Code, and the Future of IBM i Development: What Managers Should Prepare For

Author: George VanEaton
Project: The RPG Blend
Topic: IBM i Modernization, AI-Assisted Development, VS Code Adoption

Overview

Project Bob represents a major shift in how IBM i developers will work over the next decade. It extends the VS Code experience with IBM’s new AI-powered development assistant, offering capabilities that go far beyond syntax highlighting or extensions. Bob is a full IBM i–aware IDE with reasoning, planning, modernization support, and coding standards enforcement.

For managers, this shift is not just about adopting a tool. It affects training, workflows, responsibility boundaries, quality standards, and team culture.

This document outlines what leaders need to prepare for.

Why Project Bob Changes Everything
1. An RPG-Focused AI Development Environment

Bob is a VS Code fork built specifically for IBM i and RPG. It understands the language, data structures, dependencies, and legacy patterns that traditional AI tools misinterpret.

Bob is able to:

Parse fixed-format RPG and produce structured summaries

Suggest refactoring paths that match your team’s standards

Generate documentation, diagrams, and architectural models

Perform impact analysis on schema and program changes

Convert code to free-form using step-by-step reasoning

Ask clarifying questions before acting

This eliminates many barriers that previously slowed modernization efforts.

2. Coding Standards Become Enforceable

With Bob Rules, teams can define their own standards inside a project folder (.bob/). Bob then generates or modifies code to match those rules automatically.

Examples include:

Naming conventions

Free-form RPG requirements

SQL standards and join structure

Error handling patterns

Service program structure

Unit testing templates

This lets managers scale consistency across teams without manual review.

3. AI Support Reduces Cognitive Load

Bob acts as a reasoning engine that decomposes tasks into subtasks. Complex work becomes manageable:

Converting legacy modules

Detecting unused procedures

Reviewing SQL for performance problems

Tracing the business workflow inside a monolithic program

Creating ER diagrams from DDS or SQL DDL

Generating README documentation

This helps new developers learn faster and experienced developers spend less time on repetitive tasks.

What Managers Should Prepare For
1. A Cultural Shift in How Developers Work

Developers will move from tool-driven coding to context-driven coding. Instead of memorizing legacy structures, they will rely on the IDE to surface relationships, dependencies, and explanations.

Managers must prepare for:

Developers asking the IDE before asking a senior engineer

Faster onboarding of junior RPG developers

A shift from tribal knowledge to documented knowledge

Reduced resistance to modernization once Bob shows the path

2. New Workflows

Several long-standing workflows will change:

Old Workflow	New Workflow with Bob
SEU/green screen editing	Full VS Code development
Tribal knowledge debugging	AI-generated explanations
Manual code reviews	Bob-assisted reviews with standards
Manual documentation	AI-generated documentation and diagrams
Fixed-format maintenance	Free-form RPG with auto-conversion
Trial-and-error refactoring	Planned, agentic modernization steps

Managers must align their processes with these changes.

3. Training and Re-Skilling

A successful transition requires time and structured practice, not pressure.

Recommended steps:

Dedicate weekly training slots for VS Code and Bob

Build small modernization tasks into regular work

Train developers to create effective prompts

Encourage them to track before/after productivity

Mentor teams through early resistance

Skills to emphasize:

Free-form RPG

SQL and database-first design

Service program architecture

Git and GitHub workflows

IDE-based debugging

Unit testing with RPGUnit

4. Preparing for the AI-Augmented Role

Developers will spend less time on:

Syntax

Repetitive queries

DDS conversions

Documentation

File analysis

Basic refactoring

They will spend more time on:

Architecture

Business rules

Validation

Integration patterns

Reviewing AI output

Teaching the AI their project context

The role shifts from “code generator” to “code designer.”

What Workflows Disappear

SEU and PDM as primary editors

Massive comment blocks documenting every field

Hand-built impact analysis

Manual DDS-to-DDL transformations

Large monolithic code rewrites without guidance

Guessing about side effects of file changes

Reading code line-by-line to understand a workflow

Documentation gaps between teams

Bob replaces all of these with structured automation.

What New Habits Developers Must Adopt

Writing clear prompts

Attaching context files to Bob

Following Bob Rules consistently

Using Git branches professionally

Running Bob Code Reviews before merging

Letting the IDE handle exploration rather than memorizing

Using generated documentation to explain changes

Bob rewards clarity and penalizes vague instructions.

How to Prepare Now (Before GA Release)

Move development to VS Code today.
Even without Bob, teams need time to practice in the new environment.

Start building coding standards.
These standards will eventually become your Bob Rules.

Convert small programs to free-form.
Build muscle memory before AI enters the loop.

Document databases and modules.
Bob will use this context for better accuracy.

Train teams on Git and GitHub.
Bob integrates deeply with MCP-based Git workflows.

Prepare your culture for AI-assisted development.
Make it clear:
AI does not replace RPG developers.
It accelerates them.

Pick a small modernization pilot.
Use it as the test bed once Bob becomes available.

Final Thoughts

Project Bob represents one of the biggest steps forward in IBM i development in decades. The shops that prepare early—training teams, documenting systems, defining coding standards, and building comfort with VS Code—will move faster with higher quality and far less risk.

Modernization is no longer a rewrite.
It is a guided evolution supported by AI and built into the daily workflow.
