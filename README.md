Real Code. Real Coffee. No Nonsense.

Welcome to The RPG Blend, a beginner-friendly series for learning modern RPG on the IBM i. Whether you’re new to the platform or just getting started with free-form RPG and SQL, this is where you get real examples, clear explanations, and a smooth learning curve—one sip at a time.

📚 Articles
Each article corresponds to a hands-on tutorial with all code samples included here in this repo.

Getting Started with RPG (and Coffee): https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7339259381517049858/
Set up your PUB400 dev environment, write your first “Hello, World,” and learn what makes RPG different (and powerful).

Brewing Your First File Read: https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7336126464414674944/
Create a SQL table, insert test data, and write your first embedded SQL RPGLE program to read and display records—without DDS.

More articles coming soon: file writing, conditional logic, user input, and beyond.

☕ What You’ll Find Here
QSQLSRC/ – SQL scripts for creating and populating tables

QRPGLESRC/ – Free-form RPGLE programs, all written with embedded SQL

Step-by-step comments to help you learn as you read

Clean, working examples designed for PUB400

An account on PUB400.com

Basic familiarity with IBM i and 5250 emulator (Mocha TN5250, ACS, etc.)

RPGLE knowledge not required—these tutorials are for beginners

🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repo or copy/paste the code into your PUB400 source members.

Use STRSQL or RUNSQLSTM to create tables.

Compile RPGLE code using CRTSQLRPGI.

Run your programs and watch the results appear on screen (or better yet, in a log file or display panel—coming soon).

☕ About the Author
Written by George VanEaton, longtime RPG developer and engineering manager.
I believe in teaching through doing, not guessing. If you're learning RPG in 2025, you deserve modern practices, working code, and a good cup of coffee.
